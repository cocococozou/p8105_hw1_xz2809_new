Homework 1
================

First, I need to load the package that I need for for data construction and manipulation. Here is the **code chunk** for loading package.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ──────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1 ──

    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.0.0     ✔ purrr   0.2.5
    ## ✔ tibble  1.4.2     ✔ dplyr   0.7.6
    ## ✔ tidyr   0.8.1     ✔ stringr 1.3.1
    ## ✔ readr   1.1.1     ✔ forcats 0.3.0

    ## ── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

Problem 1
=========

This problem focuses on variable types and coercion. Here's a **code chunk** that construct the data frame, which includes random sample, logical vector, character vector and factor vector :

``` r
p1data = tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, min=0, max=5),
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female","male", "male", "female", "female","male", "male")),
  vec_logical = as.logical(vec_numeric>2)
)

class(p1data$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] "logical"

After constructing the data, we are asked to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. The mean of numerical vector, the random sample from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution is 1.8557422. The mean of the logical vector, which indicates whether elements of the sample are greater than 2, is 0.5. On the other hand, the means of the factor vector and the character vector are bothNA and NA. The logical vector has a mean because it is recognized as "0" and "1", however, the factor vector and charater vector are not numerical values.
